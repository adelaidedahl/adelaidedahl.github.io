    "text": "My story in learning\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, I realized that I missed learning. Not just sitting in class and engaging with material but really absorbing and engaging with the topics and content I was presented with in my courses. In the age of zoom univeristy, I sought out opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and discovered the topics I was most excited about were also those for which I felt the most passionate - ocean science and art.\nSince then, I have worked towards helping students K-12 find their passion for learning. I started by leaning on my strengths in science and art to develop curricula and educational pathways, eventually engaging with students from around the world to help them identify their strengths and bolster their personal journey in education.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nI am here to work with your student to design a learning pathway that works best for them. Whether for executive functioning or college essay writing, I’m here to work with you to find and utilize each student’s superpowers while continuing to grow their interests, strengths and new skill development."

    "text": "Hi there, My name is Adelaide!\nI am a current PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying marine biology and coral reef ecology. Before coming to Santa Barbara, I got a Master’s in Biology studying the coral reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia and St. John in the US Virgin Islands.\nWhen I’m not studying or working underwater, I love to bike and ski, and spend time outdoors! As a mentor and academic tutor, I hope to encourage students to explore and discover their own passions, developing skills to carry them through all aspects of life and learning.\nBefore studying coral reefs, I completed a Bachelors of Science degree in Biology at Brown University developing skills in critical thinking, research and visual art. These skills further evolved in my undergraduate studies through courses at the Rhode Island School of Design. With passions for visual art and environmental science, I combine these interests in my work across subjects and spent time at Brown working with the Marine Biology lab on campus, studied abroad for six months in New Zealand, and served as co-captain for the Brown Women’s Rowing team.\nMy diversity of interests allows me to bring a unique perspective to each platform and helps me always return to the importance of pursuing your passions."
