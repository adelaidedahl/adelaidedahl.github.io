    "text": "Hi there, My name is Adelaide!\nI am a current PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara studying marine biology and coral reef ecology. Before coming to Santa Barbara, I got a Master’s in Biology studying the coral reefs of Moorea, French Polynesia and St. John in the US Virgin Islands.\nWhen I’m not studying or working underwater, I love to bike and ski, and spend time outdoors! As a mentor and academic tutor, I hope to encourage students to explore and discover their own passions, developing skills to carry them through all aspects of life and learning.\nBefore studying coral reefs, I completed a Bachelors of Science degree in Biology at Brown University developing skills in critical thinking, research and visual art. These skills further evolved in her undergraduate studies through courses at the Rhode Island School of Design. With passions for visual art and environmental science, I combine these interests in my work across subjects and spent time at Brown working with the Marine Biology lab on campus, studied abroad for six months in New Zealand, and served as co-captain for the Brown Women’s Rowing team. My diversity of interests allows her to bring a unique perspective to each platform and helps to highlight the importance of pursuing your passions."
